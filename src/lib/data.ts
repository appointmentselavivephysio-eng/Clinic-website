          "Knowing how long your pain has lasted helps guide treatment. Acute back pain lasts less than six weeks and is usually the result of a strain, an awkward lift, or a sudden movement. It tends to settle with gentle activity and targeted physiotherapy. Chronic back pain lasts more than twelve weeks and often has several contributing causes at once, such as weak core muscles, poor posture, old injuries, or the way you move through your day. Chronic pain rarely improves on its own, which is exactly why a structured plan matters. The window between six and twelve weeks is a warning sign that pain is becoming persistent and should be properly assessed.",

By restoring movement, building strength, and retraining how you sit, stand, and lift, physiotherapy delivers lasting relief and lowers the chance of the pain coming back. This is why leading guidelines around the world now recommend physiotherapy and exercise as the first-line treatment for most back pain, ahead of long-term medication.",
